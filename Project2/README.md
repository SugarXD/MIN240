# Project 2:

For Project 2 we were instructed to pick our favorite museum and create an ad for it. The ad had to be an extendable ad and had to have some sort of multimedia associated with it. For my ad I chose to put a video on it.

A publically accessible version of the application can be found [here](http://studenthome.nku.edu/~owensk7/Min240/Project2/index.html).
