# Project 3:

For Project 3 we had to pick our own app idea and build a prototype in Google WebDesigner. This was challenging because we had minimal JavaScript knowledge so we had to come up with creative solutions to prototype our app.

I created a "I Spy" app with animated Pokemon. The app was tailored to young children. There are currently two levels available and a “How To” Level.


A publically accessible version of the application can be found [here](http://studenthome.nku.edu/~owensk7/Min240/Project3/index.html).
