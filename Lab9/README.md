# Lab 9:

Emulated a geolocation app in Google Web Designer. The user shares their location using their GPS on their device or they enter a zip code
and the app will show them Walmart stores near them where they can buy amiibos. 

A publically accessible version of the application can be found [here](http://studenthome.nku.edu/~owensk7/Min240/Lab9/index.html).
